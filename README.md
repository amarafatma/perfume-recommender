## Unleashing the Power of Data Science to Find Your Signature Scent
Ever wondered how to discover your perfect perfume match? With my data science and machine learning wizardry, I crafted a magical solution to help you find that signature scent!

## Project Adventure
With data scraped from China's largest fragrance forum in hand, I performed some data alchemy – analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and cross-validation. Then, I conjured up a sleek web app using Streamlit.

## The Fragrant Data
Our treasure trove of data comes from China’s biggest fragrance forum. It features an enchanted table with perfume details: Name, Brand, Description, and Notes.

## The Magical Models
To cater to different perfume enthusiasts, I used Sentence-BERT for transforming the notes of the perfumes into semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared in terms of similarity metrics such as cosine similarity. Then, I used these embeddings to build a recommender system that outputs similar types of perfumes.
